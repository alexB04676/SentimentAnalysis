Sentiment Analysis with TF-IDF and Random Forest

1. Overview:

- This project performs sentiment analysis on textual reviews using machine learning. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and classification using a Random Forest Classifier. Hyperparameter tuning is applied using RandomizedSearchCV for optimal performance.

2. Project Structure:
- 1. Dataset_cleaner.py: Script to clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Converts text to lowercase.
- Removes special characters and stopwords.
- Lemmatizes words.
- Outputs a cleaned dataset in JSONL format.

- 2. main.py: Main script for:

- TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams and bigrams).
- Feature importance calculation and filtering.
- Random Forest model training with hyperparameter tuning.
- Model evaluation and optional tree visualization.

3. How To Run:
- 1. Preprocess the Dataset:
- Run the Dataset_cleaner.py script by running: "python Dataset_cleaner.py"
- Input the number of rows to preprocess (or press Enter to process the entire dataset).
- The cleaned dataset is saved as cleaned_dataset.jsonl.
- 2. Train and Evaluate the Model:
- Run the main.py script by running: "python main.py"
- This performs TF-IDF vectorization, filters the top 10% features, trains a Random Forest model, and evaluates it.
- Optionally, decision tree and TF-IDF Distribution visualizations can be generated by uncommenting their function calls.

4. Results:
- 1. Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.8 (Example output)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.5
- TF-IDF Distribution: Visualized feature importance distribution.
- Decision Tree Visualizations: Saved as PDFs in the decision_trees directory.

5. Dependencies:
- Install required libraries using: pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Key Features
- 1. Data Cleaning: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- 2. Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorization with unigrams and bigrams.
- 3. Model Training: Random Forest Classifier with Randomized Search for hyperparameter tuning.
- 4. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, MSE, and R² Score.
- 5. Visualization:
- TF-IDF importance distribution.
- Decision tree visualizations for interpretability.

PS: this is the first project that i've decided to make public on github and also the first project
i've done 95% by myself. so i'll be EXTREMELY grateful for any kind of feedback, suggestion or general
improvements. If you have an idea for a better approach or think something could be enhanced, don’t hesitate
to reach out!
